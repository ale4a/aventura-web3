# Crypto Adventura Latam

## 🚀 Inspiration

Crypto Adventura Latam is an innovative educational project that promotes the inclusion of non-traditional profiles into the web3 world, creating an interactive and gamified learning experience.

## 🛑 Problem

There is a lack of educational resources about emerging technologies fully in Spanish for traditional profiles like doctors, architects, chefs, etc., which limits their inclusion in the tech world.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

This project is built on Sepolia Scroll and ENS in testnet. We also tested deployment on Polygon.

## 🎯 Target Audience

Our target audience includes traditional web2 profiles: doctors, nurses, police officers, chefs, engineers, architects, etc.
